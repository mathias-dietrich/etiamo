# etiamo

Today is the 8th of Maz 2021. I am sitting in the living room in Frankfurt/M Sachsenhausen. It is a sunny Saturday, in front of the house in Holbeinstrasse in the litte green area some 100 folks are having a glas or bottle and the COVID 19 masks are off. I am doing the very first checkin for etiamo.com, the domain i am carrying with me since 2012, 9 years in the making, we better be good on this one! 

The time has come, the blockchain was the missing tech to make thsi possible. The idea is so simple that i believe in it. 
Let's see how far we can bring this one. The basic concept i have since a long time, now the time is right to do it.
